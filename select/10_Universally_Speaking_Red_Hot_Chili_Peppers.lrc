[00:15.79] I saw your face
[00:21.85] Elegant and tired
[00:27.02] Cut up from the chase
[00:29.93] Still, I so admired
[00:39.43] 
[00:35.08] Bloodshot your smile
[00:38.28] Delicate and wild
[00:43.34] Give me she-wolf style
[00:46.86] Rip right through me
[00:56.86] 
[00:49.45] Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
[00:53.45] Go and get her I've got her on my mind
[00:57.71] Nothing better
[00:59.06] The feeling is so fine
[01:01.72] Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[01:10.08] Come on baby 'cause there's no name for
[01:14.04] Give it up and I got what I came for
[01:18.28] Universally speaking, I
[01:22.51] Take it back and you make me nervous
[01:26.25] Nothing better than love and service
[01:31.03] Universally speaking I
[01:36.92] Win in the long run
[01:46.42] 
[01:59.36] I saw your crime
[02:05.56] Dying to get high
[02:10.06] Two of a kind
[02:13.51] Beats our hands tonight
[02:25.01] 
[02:16.28] Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
[02:20.72] Go and get her I've got her on my mind
[02:24.80] All the better to make it so fine
[02:29.03] Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[02:48.53] 
[02:37.02] Come on baby 'cause there's no name for
[02:41.07] Give it up and I got what I came for
[02:45.39] Universally speaking, I
[02:49.51] Take it back and you make me nervous
[02:53.82] Nothing better than love and service
[02:58.12] Universally speaking, I
[03:03.92] Win in the long run
[03:13.42] 
[03:09.80] Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
[03:14.69] Go and get her, I got her on my mind
[03:18.37] Nothing better the feeling it so fine
[03:22.66] Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
