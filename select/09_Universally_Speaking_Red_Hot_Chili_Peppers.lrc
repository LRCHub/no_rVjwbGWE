[00:16.81] I saw your face
[00:22.15] Elegant and tired
[00:27.18] Cut up from the chase
[00:30.53] Still, I so admired
[00:40.03] 
[00:35.30] Bloodshot your smile
[00:38.75] Delicate and wild
[00:43.36] Give me she-wolf style
[00:46.51] Rip right through me
[00:56.51] 
[00:49.18] Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
[00:53.37] Go and get her I've got her on my mind
[00:57.79] Nothing better
[00:58.81] The feeling is so fine
[01:01.40] Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[01:09.93] Come on baby 'cause there's no name for
[01:14.19] Give it up and I got what I came for
[01:17.97] Universally speaking, I
[01:22.32] Take it back and you make me nervous
[01:26.63] Nothing better than love and service
[01:30.45] Universally speaking I
[01:36.40] Win in the long run
[01:45.90] 
[01:59.41] I saw your crime
[02:04.94] Dying to get high
[02:10.00] Two of a kind
[02:13.14] Beats our hands tonight
[02:24.64] 
[02:16.12] Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
[02:19.98] Go and get her I've got her on my mind
[02:24.01] All the better to make it so fine
[02:28.13] Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[02:47.63] 
[02:36.43] Come on baby 'cause there's no name for
[02:40.34] Give it up and I got what I came for
[02:44.81] Universally speaking, I
[02:48.94] Take it back and you make me nervous
[02:52.88] Nothing better than love and service
[02:57.30] Universally speaking, I
[03:02.78] Win in the long run
[03:12.28] 
[03:10.18] Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
[03:13.75] Go and get her, I got her on my mind
[03:17.84] Nothing better the feeling it so fine
[03:21.99] Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
